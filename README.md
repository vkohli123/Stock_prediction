# Stock_prediction
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) project for predicting stock market prices would use historical stock market data as input for the model. 
The LSTM network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), would analyze the data and learn from past patterns to make predictions about future stock prices. 
The project would likely include preprocessing of the data to handle missing values and format it for the LSTM model, training of the model on a portion of the data, 
and testing the model on a separate portion of the data to evaluate its performance.
The goal of the project would be to develop a model that can accurately predict future stock prices.
